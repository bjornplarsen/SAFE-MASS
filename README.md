The SAFE-MASS framework aims to move beyond conventional siloed approaches by offering an integrative taxonomy that addresses the evolving cybersecurity landscape in maritime operations. By framing the problem through the lens of human-machine interaction, evolving autonomy, and regulatory gaps, it provides a foundation for fostering resilience and innovation within the MASS ecosystem.
